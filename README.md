A simple solver for playing with the basics of Multiple Integer Programming.

This is just a toy solver that I hope to play with for a while, it currently only consists of a basic linear programming solver.

The solver currently supports rows with less than or equal bounds and only performs maximisation.

You also have to add in slack variables manually. Just add one in for each row and set it's coefficient in the matrix to 1 for that row only.
